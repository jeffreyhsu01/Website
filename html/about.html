                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Jeffrey Hsu and I am a current sophomore at Boston University studying Computer Science & Statistics. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Cupertino, CA and am fortunate enough to have attended high school in Taipei, Taiwan. During my junior year of HS I took AP Computer Science and never looked back since. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In college, I really enjoyed going to hackathons, and so joined BostonHacks to help cultivate the hackathon cultuure at Boston University. I also joined joined Phi Chi Theta, a professional fraternity, to get more exposure with software development. From the organization I was able to partake in some projfects that really helped me cultivate my skills as a developer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I embrace my love of learning and desire to contribute to the innovative and important world of software. Currently looking for 2021 SWE or Data Science internships.
                </p>
