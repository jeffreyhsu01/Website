                <p>
                    I love Netflix. But it frustrates me to no end when I spend a good 15 minutes a night trying to find a show that is worth the precious time to sit through and watch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Obviously this is the most “first-world problem” ever, and I don’t want to come across as some arrogant person. But I do admit that after  Netflix changed its algorithms, I’ve always had a tab open for IMDb, to check back and forth the ratings of movies, TV shows, or documentaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result I decided to build a Chrome extension that could help save some time by displaying the rating of the title directly on the information card.
