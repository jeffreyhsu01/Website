                    Hello! My name is Jeffrey Hsu and I am a current sophomore at Boston University studying Computer Science & Statistics. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Cupertino, CA and attended high school in Taipei, Taiwan. During my junior year of HS I took AP Computer Science and never looked back since. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m really enjoying the journey so far and can’t wait for what else is yet to come. I am comfortable with working with 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I embrace my love of learning and desire to contribute to the innovative and important world of software. Currently looking for 2021 SWE or Data Science internships.
                </p>
